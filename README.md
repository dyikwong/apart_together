# apart_together
Apart, Together is an Android app built with the intention of connecting families together during this current pandemic, where family members might not be in contact with each other, living in different places across the country, or even the world. Our aim was to make it especially accessible to demographics who aren’t very familiar with current technology and social media—especially elders—by creating an app that allows for a centralized, easy-to-use communication system for families. Through this, they would be able to keep track of each others’ health and conditions, especially regarding positive and negative COVID-19 tests, more easily.
